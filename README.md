# Yoline

__Work in progress!__

Yoline is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) based on Node.js.

## Why a new CMS?

I wanted to do blogs for friends with Node.js but I don't really like to use Ghost or other.

Then I'll do myself my own CMS.

I didn't use Browserify and SASS, it will be an example to me.

## Why this beautiful name?

Because _Broccoli_, _Ghost_ or _Brunch_ have shit name.

## What is the frequency of publication?

I think this project will be the last project I will update in my free time.

## API

I think there will be an API like [Learn Memory's API](https://github.com/cedced19/learn-memory#api).
