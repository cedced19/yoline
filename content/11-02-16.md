title: Learn Memory Static
---

Today I created [Learn Memory Static](https://github.com/cedced19/learn-memory-static).  
The main goal was to publish my lessons without give my server ip adress.

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone --depth=1 --branch=master https://github.com/cedced19/zikcenter-static
$ npm install --production
$ node data-generator.js -f data.json
```
